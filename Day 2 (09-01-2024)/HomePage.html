        <h1><u>History of HTML</u> </h1>
        <h3>A Brief History of HTML</h3>
        <p><b>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993.</b> Since then, there have been many different
            versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official
            standard in December 1999.</p>

        <h3>Examples of types of content that can be included on web pages</h3>
        <p>
            The following table shows a list of many of the types of content that can be added to web pages using
            different versions of HTML. <i>In the early days of the Web, HTML (version 1.2) was very simple, but over time
            new versions were released that added more and more features.</i>

        <div>
        <h3>Block-level Elements</h3>
        <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
            <ul>
                <li> <em>A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</em></li>
               <ul>
                <li>Two commonly used block elements are: p and div .</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>The p element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.</li>
                    <li>The div element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.</li>
                </ol>
